# Collaboration with Beneath the Tree: Key Outcomes, Lessons Learned, and Challenges

## Collaboration and Outcomes

From September to November, Women Leaders in Technology (WLiT) collaborated with Beneath the Tree (BTT) to conduct technical sessions focused on building interactive kiosks. The sessions aimed to prepare a kiosk trainer within WLiT to subsequently train members of the Trans (Queer, LGBTIQ) community as part of the Pride Tech Kiosk Roadshow. The three kiosks planned were:

- A two-wheeled car robot.
- Animation creation using Scratch.
- A maze navigation task using the robot.

While the Scratch animation session was successfully included in the roadshow, hardware and technical challenges prevented the effective deployment of the robot-based kiosks. To address this gap, an additional session on creating LED-powered greeting cards was introduced, adding an engaging and practical element to the roadshow.

## Challenges Faced

### Technical Challenges
- **Procurement Issues:** Difficulty in acquiring hardware items like specific screws, bolts, and drivers due to limited availability in Nepal caused delays and necessitated design modifications.  
- **Debugging Failures:** Persistent issues with the two-wheeled car robot hindered its functionality. Despite testing alternative software (e.g., Arduino IDE vs. Mblock) and hardware configurations, the robot failed to perform reliably.  
- **Kiosk Exclusion:** The unreliability of the robot rendered the third kiosk infeasible for inclusion in the roadshow.

### Logistical Challenges
- **Transportation Concerns:** The transport of delicate hardware like the robot posed challenges, especially during air travel between cities.  
- **Coordination Demands:** Managing training materials and ensuring a seamless setup in three cities required extensive coordination efforts.

### Participant Engagement Challenges
- **Language Barriers:** Limited inclusivity was observed in Janakpur due to the primary language being Maithili, which was unfamiliar to the trainers.  
- **Session Preferences:** Participants showed a strong preference for theoretical but relevant topics, such as data security, over hardware-based activities.

## Lessons Learned

### Flexibility and Adaptation
The necessity to adapt hardware designs due to unavailable components highlighted the importance of relying on locally accessible resources. For instance, 3D-printed mounts and superglue were used as substitutes for hard-to-find screws and spacers.

### Frequent Debugging and Diagnostics
Persistent technical issues with the robot emphasized the importance of rigorous pre-deployment testing. Multiple potential causes—faulty sensors, software glitches, or connection issues—were explored, but no lasting resolution was found.

### Incorporation of Trainee Feedback
Feedback from participants underscored the importance of tailoring sessions to their immediate needs and interests. Practical topics such as digital privacy and data security were highly preferred over hardware-based activities. Additionally, language accessibility highlighted the need for language-sensitive content delivery in future initiatives.
